# Users can abuse callbacks in Native Token to get mispriced deposits, wasting L2 blockspace

### Summary

Gas for deposits is charged on L1 by burning gas in proportion to the amount of gas requested for execution on L2. However, only additional gas beyond what has already been used in the deposit is burned.

Because the `_depositTransaction()` function [now contains a `safeTransferFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L529-L531) (which could callback to the user in the case that an ERC777 is used), users can waste gas mid execution to avoid being charged for deposits, and then get refunded for 96% of this spending by the SSTORE refund mechanism.

### Root Cause

To price deposits, [the following logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L126-L147) is used:
1) Take the user's requested L2 gas limit and multiply it by the ResourceMetering contract's gas price (calculated using an EIP1559 style mechanism).
2) Calculate the value of the gas the user has actually used in execution of the deposit transaction.
3) If the calculated amount to burn is greater than the amount actually used, burn the difference.

To understand this exploit, some context is necessary about gas refunds. Since [EIP 2200](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2200.md), gas for SSTORE works as following:
- Storing a non-zero value in a slot that was previously 0 costs 20,000 gas
- If we reset that slot to a zero value in the same transaction, we are refunded 19,200 gas
- Importantly, this refund happens at the end of the transaction execution, and does not impact the `gasleft()` opcode

Putting these two facts together, we can see the problem. If an ERC777 token is used as the native token (which doesn't break any of the requirements outlined in the README), the user will receive a callback mid-execution of `depositTransaction()`.

They can use this callback to set a large number of storage slots from zero to non-zero and back to zero. The result will be a large jump in gas used, which will make the deposit transaction free, despite 96% of this gas being refunded.

### Internal Preconditions

1. Native Token must have a callback to the sender.

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

Let's focus on an attack that will fill the full deposit limit for the block of 20 million gas. This would block all other deposits from happening on a given block, and clog up 66% of L2 block space for the block as well.

Let's make the assumption that L1 gas is 50x more expensive than L2 gas, which is probably an understatement but doesn't really matter for the attack. We'll assume an L1 price of 50 gwei and L2 price of 1 gwei.

1. A user calls `depositTransaction()` from a contract.
2. In this contract, the callback from the Native Token triggers a large number of SSTOREs, going from zero to non-zero to zero. Specifically, each cycle will use `20_000 + 800 = 20_800` gas, we'll 50x to adjust to `20_800 * 50 = 1_040_000`, so we will need 20 slots to fill the block.
3. When the ResourceMetering contract performs its calculations, it will see that the user has spent sufficient gas that no more needs to be burned, and the transaction will proceed without any extra cost.
4. This costs the user `20_800 * 20 = 416_000` L1 gas, which should cost `416_000 * 50 = 20_800_000 gwei`.
5. However, because each of these slots is returned to zero, we get a refund of `19_200 * 20 = 384_000` gas.
6. This means that the user will only pay `416_000 - 384_000 = 32_000` gas, which at 50 gwei per gas is `1_600_000 gwei` or `0.0016 ETH` ($3-4 at current prices).

### Impact

Deposit transactions can be paid for at a fraction of the expected cost, allowing users to DOS deposits and stuff L2 blocks at a low cost.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

- Option 1: Do not allow tokens with callbacks to be used as the Native Token.
- Option 2: Change the burn mechanism to not account for gas spent in the transaction, which will slightly increase the amount charged but should work itself out based on the bridge base fee.
