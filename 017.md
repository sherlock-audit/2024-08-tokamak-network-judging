# Governance manipulation attack on ````NativeTokens````

### Summary

With the help of governance platforms, such as ````snapshot.org```` and ````aragon.org````, ````thousands of standard```` ERC20 tokens are working as governance tokens. If these tokens were set as ````NativeTokens````, the current improper implementation of ````OptimismPortal2```` would cause those tokens suffering governance manipulation attack.

### Root Cause

#### (1) In high probability, there would be large amount of ````NativeToken```` held by ````OptimismPortal2```` 
As reference from ````Optimism```` and ````Base````, they both have about ````1.3 Billion```` USD worth of ````NativeToken````(ETH in their case) held in ````OptimismPortal````, we can expect  large amount of ````NativeToken```` would be held by ````OptimismPortal2```` too, as ````OptimismPortal2```` will be the L1 vault for ````NativeTokens```` which are being deposited to L2.

#### (2) For messages sent from L2 to L1, the ````target```` can be any contract except ````NativeToken```` itself
Shown as [L382-384](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L382~L384) of ````OptimismPortal2.sol````
```solidity
File: src\L1\OptimismPortal2.sol
356:     function finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof(
357:         Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
358:         address _proofSubmitter
359:     )
...
362:     {
...
382:         require(
383:             _tx.target != _nativeTokenAddress, "Optimism Portal: cannot make a direct call to native token contract"
384:         );
...
429:     }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

Any of these governance  token are set as ````NativeToken```` 

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

#### (1) Attack case for governance tokens using ````snapshot.org```` platform
We can find there are thousands of projects are using ERC20 balance as voting power (https://snapshot.org/#/?filter=strategies&q=erc20-balance-of), and many of them enabled voting delegation. If any of these tokens are also working as ````NativeToken````, then attackers can send a ````L2 -> L1```` message with ````snapshot````'s unified ````DelegateRegistry```` contract ([link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446#code)) as target to delegate ````OptimismPortal2```` 's huge voting power to some malicious address controlled by attacker.
```solidity
File: https://etherscan.io/address/0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446#code:DelegateRegistry.sol
19:     function setDelegate(bytes32 id, address delegate) public {
 // @audit msg.sender=OptimismPortal2, id= governance space, delegate= malicious EOA
20:         require (delegate != msg.sender, "Can't delegate to self");
21:         require (delegate != address(0), "Can't delegate to 0x0");
22:         address currentDelegate = delegation[msg.sender][id];
23:         require (delegate != currentDelegate, "Already delegated to this address");
24:         
25:         // Update delegation mapping
26:         delegation[msg.sender][id] = delegate;
27:         
28:         if (currentDelegate != address(0)) {
29:             emit ClearDelegate(msg.sender, id, currentDelegate);
30:         }
31: 
32:         emit SetDelegate(msg.sender, id, delegate);
33:     }

```

#### (2) Attack case for governance tokens using ````aragon.org```` framework
Under argon framework, there are separated voting contract instances for each project, let's take the well known ````Lido```` project for example https://vote.lido.fi/, the governance token is LDO:[0x5A98FcBEA516Cf06857215779Fd812CA3beF1B32](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32) (link: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-dao/)), and it's argon voting contract is [0x2e59A20f205bB85a89C53f1936454680651E618e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e#readProxyContract). If LDO was working as ````NativeToken````, then attackers can send a ````L2 -> L1```` message with the argon voting contract as target to delegate ````OptimismPortal2```` 's huge voting power to some malicious address by calling ````assignDelegate()````
```solidity
File: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e#Voting.sol
259:     function assignDelegate(address _delegate) external { // @audit __delegate=malicious account
260:         require(_delegate != address(0), ERROR_ZERO_ADDRESS_PASSED);
261:         require(_delegate != msg.sender, ERROR_SELF_DELEGATE);
262: 
263:         address prevDelegate = delegates[msg.sender].delegate; // @audit msg.sender=OptimismPortal2
264:         require(_delegate != prevDelegate, ERROR_DELEGATE_SAME_AS_PREV);
265: 
266:         if (prevDelegate != address(0)) {
267:             _removeDelegatedAddressFor(prevDelegate, msg.sender);
268:         }
269:         _addDelegatedAddressFor(_delegate, msg.sender);
270:     }
```
Or, calling ````vote()```` to directly vote for some malicious proposal
```solidity
File: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e#Voting.sol
232:     function vote(uint256 _voteId, bool _supports, bool /* _executesIfDecided_deprecated */) external voteExists(_voteId) {
233:         Vote storage vote_ = votes[_voteId];
234:         VotePhase votePhase = _getVotePhase(vote_);
235:         require(_isValidPhaseToVote(votePhase, _supports), ERROR_CAN_NOT_VOTE);
236: 
...
240:         uint256 votingPower = token.balanceOfAt(msg.sender, vote_.snapshotBlock);
241:         require(votingPower > 0, ERROR_NO_VOTING_POWER);
242:         _vote(_voteId, votePhase, /* voter */ msg.sender, _supports, votingPower, /* isDelegate */ false);
243:     }

```

#### (3) Though this report doesn't check all governance platforms and frameworks, but there are high chance the other governance frameworks and tokens suffer similar attack vectors


### Impact

Widely governance manipulation attack to produce unconstrained damage

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding a target blacklist to allow the admin to manage dangerous targets of all kinds, such as
