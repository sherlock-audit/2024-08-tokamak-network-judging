# Tokens May Become Stuck in relayMessage When Target Cannot Retrieve Them

## Summary
The [relayMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L222-L329) function in the [L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol) contract may cause tokens to become permanently stuck if the target address cannot retrieve approved tokens. This occurs when tokens are approved to a target that doesn't or can't call `transferFrom`, such as an Externally Owned Account (EOA) or a contract lacking the necessary logic. As a result, tokens remain stuck in the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract with no means of recovery.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the [relayMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L222-L329) function. 

- When the `relayMessage` function is called with a non-zero `_value` (amount of tokens to be sent), it performs the following actions:

1. Approves the `_target` address to spend _value amount of the native token (`_nativeTokenAddress`) by calling `approve`.
2. Expects the `_target` contract to call transferFrom to retrieve the tokens.
3. Resets the approval after the external call to the `_target`.

- The issue arises because:

1. If the `_target` is an `EOA` (function does not validate against EOAs), EOA cannot call transferFrom to obtain the tokens.
2. If the `_target` is a contract that does not implement the logic to call transferFrom, it will not retrieve the tokens.
3. As a result, the tokens remain in the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract indefinitely, effectively becoming inaccessible.


## Impact
Needless to say that:

Users may lose tokens if they send them to targets incapable of retrieving them.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L222-L329

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate the target address by ensuring that tokens are only approved to contract addresses:
```solidity
  import { Address } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

require(
    msg.value == 0 && (Address.isContract(_target) || _value == 0),
    "Invalid input: msg.value must be zero; target must be a contract when transferring tokens"
);
```
Here we check If `_value > 0`, `_target` must be a contract (`Address.isContract(_target)` returns true) as it prevents tokens from being approved to EOAs.
