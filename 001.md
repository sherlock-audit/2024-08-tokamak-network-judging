# Loss of Tokens if Recipient is EOA During L2-to-L1 Bridging

**Description**

When bridging tokens from L2 to L1, if the recipient address `(L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage(address _target))` is an externally owned account (EOA) instead of a contract, the recipient will not be able to receive the bridged tokens on L1. This is because EOAs are not smart contracts and there's no function to invoke to use transferFrom(L1CrossDomainMessenger, user, _value) when low-level call is triggered on `relayMessage::_target` parameter.

**Impact**

High: Users can permanently lose tokens when bridging through the cross-domain messenger if the recipient is not a smart contract.

**Proof of Concepts**

lets say user calls `L2CrossDomainMessenger::sendMessage(address _target,,)` function to brige `msg.value` amount to L1 and user passes his L1 EOA account address as `_target` parameter to this function. this function emits events that will be listened by Optimism Portal.

then `OptimismPortal` gets triggered and calls `L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage(,, address _target,,, )` function to bridge tokens from L2 to L1. inside this function we have this code that basically approves `_target` to be able to use transferFrom() to get his tokens, but the thing is we can't make sure that the `_target` passed in, is always a contract:

[L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L300-L307](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L300-L307)

```javascript
        if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
            IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, _value);
        }

        // _target is expected to perform a transferFrom to collect token
        bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, 0, _message); 
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
        if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {

            IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, 0);

        }
```

if the `_target` is an EOA, this will result in revert and loss of funds.


**Recommended mitigation**

just simply use `IERC20.transfer()`:

```javascript
        IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).safeTransfer(_target, _value);
```
