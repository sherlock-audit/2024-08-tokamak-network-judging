# Reentrancy leading to the unintended retention of token approvals, which can result in unauthorized token transfers

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Approval Before External Call:**
   - The contract approves `_tx.target` to spend `_tx.value` amount of tokens from the portal's balance.
   - This is done using `IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_tx.target, _tx.value);`.

2. **External Call to Target Contract:**
   - The portal then makes a call to `_tx.target` using `SafeCall.callWithMinGas`.
   - If `_tx.data.length != 0`, the call is executed; otherwise, it skips the call.

3. **Resetting the Approval:**
   - After the call, the contract attempts to reset the approval back to zero using `IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_tx.target, 0);`.

4. **Potential Reentrancy and Revert Scenario:**
   - If the target contract is malicious, it can deliberately cause the external call to revert.
   - Since the approval reset occurs **after** the external call, a revert will prevent the approval from being reset.
   - The `approve` function does not revert the initial approval, and the allowance remains set.

5. **Exploiting the Unreset Approval:**
   - With the approval still in place, the attacker can call `transferFrom` on the token contract to transfer tokens from the portal to an address of their choosing.
   - This effectively allows the attacker to drain tokens from the portal's balance.

### Steps to Reproduce the Vulnerability

1. **Craft a Malicious Target Contract:**
   - The attacker deploys a contract that, when called, deliberately reverts the transaction.

2. **Initiate a Withdrawal:**
   - The attacker submits a withdrawal transaction where `_tx.target` is the address of their malicious contract and `_tx.value` is the amount of tokens they wish to steal.

3. **Trigger the Vulnerable Function:**
   - The attacker calls `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` with the crafted `_tx`.

4. **Approval Remains Unchanged Due to Revert:**
   - The external call to the malicious contract reverts.
   - The approval reset logic is not executed because the function reverts.

5. **Drain Tokens Using Unreset Approval:**
   - The attacker now has an active approval to spend `_tx.value` tokens from the portal's balance.
   - They call `transferFrom` on the token contract to transfer tokens from the portal to their own address.

## Impact

- **Loss of Funds:** The portal's token balance can be drained by attackers exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Reentrancy Risk:** Although reentrancy is somewhat mitigated by the `l2Sender` check, the approval issue opens a vector for reentrancy-like attacks.
