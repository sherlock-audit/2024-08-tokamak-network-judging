# [H-1] `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` function does not have access control, opening it up to bypass the protocol checks and deposit tokens on `OptimismPortal2` contract

### Summary

Inside `L1CrossDomainMessenger::sendNativeTokenMessage` > `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendMessage`, the portal address is set as unsafe (by using `_isUnsafeTarget` function) for `sendNativeTokenMessage` function call. Which means that a user can not set the portal address as the target address for native token transaction. But, if we take a look at  `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` function, it is set as external and currently it does not have any access control. This means that for a transaction which would have otherwise reverted by the `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendMessage`, it can be directly triggered by using `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction`. This bypasses the protocol checks and will result in Native token being deposited on the portal itself.

### Root Cause

Missing check for the unsafe `to` address in `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. An actor uses a contract that triggers `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` directly.
2. The function calls `OptimismPortal2::_depositTransaction` function
3. The function does not check if `_to` address is an unsafe address and once all the other checks have completed, the event `TransactionDeposited` is emitted.

### Attack Path

1. An actor uses a contract that triggers `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` directly.
2. The function calls `OptimismPortal2::_depositTransaction` function
3. The function does not check if `_to` address is an unsafe address and once all the other checks have completed, the event `TransactionDeposited` is emitted.

### Impact

Native tokens can be deposited on the portal, bypassing the checks set in `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendMessage`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add access control to the `OptimismPortal2::depositTransaction` function either in the form of a modifier or a check within the function which would revert the transaction of the address is unsafe, i.e., the portal address.

```diff
    function depositTransaction(
        address _to,
        uint256 _mint,
        uint256 _value,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        bool _isCreation,
        bytes calldata _data
    )
        external
    {
+       if(_to == address(this)){
+           revert("Can not deposit to the portal itself")
+       }
        _depositTransaction(msg.sender, _to, _mint, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data, false);
    }
```
