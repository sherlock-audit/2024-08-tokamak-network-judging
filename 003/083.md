# • If the value of deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] is insufficient, it can result in an underflow, causing the transaction to revert.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

• If the value of deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] is insufficient, it can result in an underflow, causing the transaction to revert.
• An attacker might attempt to call finalizeBridgeERC20 with repeated or forged messages, trying to deplete the balance from the deposits mapping.

## Impact

Denial of Service Attack: An attacker could prevent legitimate bridging operations, leading to service unavailability.
• Locked Funds: If the deposits balance is incorrectly reduced, it could lead to funds being locked in the contract.
