# [M-1] `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendNativeTokenMessage` has no check for `_amount` value 0, resulting in the `relayMessage` to trigger even for the 0 value

### Summary

`L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendNativeTokenMessage` has no check for `_amount` value 0, resulting in the `relayMessage` to trigger even for the 0 value. This means than the function call will not fail even when the `amount` is zero in the call.

### Root Cause

There is a missing check for when `_amount` is equal to `0` in `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendNativeTokenMessage` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `L1StandardBridge::_initiateBridgeNativeToken` is initated with 0 value for the native token amount.
2. `sendNativeTokenMessage` function is invoked on `L1CrossDomainMessenger` which in turn calls `_sendNativeTokenMessage` function.
3. `_sendNativeTokenMessage` triggers `_sendMessage` which emits the `SentMessage` and `SentMessageExtension1` events. Thoughout this chain, we are not checking if the amount is equal to 0. This results in the event emitted for the zero value as well.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The users will be able to trigger native token calls with zero token amount as well.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a conditional to handle the case when `_amount` is equal to `0`. For example, if a revert is to be expected, than and else clause can be added to  to the `L1CrossDomainMessenger::_sendNativeTokenMessage` function.

```diff
{
        // Collect native token
        if (_amount > 0) {
            address _nativeTokenAddress = nativeTokenAddress();
            IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), _amount);
            IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(address(portal), _amount);
        }
+       else {
+           revert("Native Token amount should be greater than 0")
+       }
        // Triggers a message to the other messenger. Note that the amount of gas provided to the
        // message is the amount of gas requested by the user PLUS the base gas value. We want to
        // guarantee the property that the call to the target contract will always have at least
        // the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
        _sendMessage(
            address(otherMessenger),
            baseGas(_message, _minGasLimit),
            _amount,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                this.relayMessage.selector, messageNonce(), _sender, _target, _amount, _minGasLimit, _message
            )
        );
```
