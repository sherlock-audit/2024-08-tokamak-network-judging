# Smart contract users can Bridge ETH or ERC20 tokens from their account to themselves with `bridgeETHTo` and `bridgeERC20To` functions

## Summary

Smart contract users are limited to bridging ETH or ERC20 tokens to themselves because of the `onlyEOA` modifier in the `bridgeETH` and `bridgeERC20` functions. However, they can bridge ETH or ERC20 tokens using the `bridgeETHTo` and `bridgeERC20To` functions without any restrictions, which provide the same functionality as `bridgeETH` and `bridgeERC20`. The only requirement for smart contract users is to set the `_to` parameter of the `bridgeETHTo` and `bridgeERC20To` functions to the address of their contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the test below, it is expected that a smart contract user cannot bridge ETH when the destination address (`_to`) is set to `msg.sender`. However, it runs without any issues, resulting in the test failing.

Please copy the test function below and add it to the end of the L1StandardBridge.t.sol file.
```solidity
  contract MyL1StandardBridge is Bridge_Initializer {
    function test_smartContractUserCanBridgeETH() external {
      vm.startPrank(bob);
      UserContract userContract = new UserContract(l1StandardBridge);
      (bool success, ) = address(userContract).call{value: 1 ether}('');
      require(success, 'failed');
      vm.expectRevert();
      userContract.bridgeWith_bridgeETHTo();
      vm.stopPrank();
    }
  }


  contract UserContract {
    L1StandardBridge l1StandardBridge;
    address owner;

    constructor(L1StandardBridge _l1Bridge) {
      l1StandardBridge = _l1Bridge;
      owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
      if (msg.sender != owner) revert();
      _;
    }

    function bridgeWith_bridgeETH() external onlyOwner {
      l1StandardBridge.bridgeETH{value: 1 ether}(50000, hex'');
    }

    function bridgeWith_bridgeETHTo() external onlyOwner {
      l1StandardBridge.bridgeETHTo{value: 1 ether}(msg.sender, 50000, hex'');
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}

```  


## Recommendation

`msg.sender` and `_to` should not be the same in the `bridgeETHTo` and `bridgeERC20To` functions. Therefore, we can perform this check at the beginning of these two functions. If EOA (Externally Owned Account) users want to bridge ETH or ERC20 tokens to themselves, they can use the `bridgeETH` and `bridgeERC20` functions as intended.


```diff
function bridgeETHTo(address _to, uint32 _minGasLimit, bytes calldata _extraData) public payable {
+        require(_to != msg.sender, "use bridgeETH instead!!");
        _initiateBridgeETH(msg.sender, _to, msg.value, _minGasLimit, _extraData);
    }
```

```diff
    function bridgeERC20To(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _minGasLimit,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    )
        public
        virtual
    {
+        require(_to != msg.sender, "use bridgeERC20 instead!!");
        _initiateBridgeERC20(_localToken, _remoteToken, msg.sender, _to, _amount, _minGasLimit, _extraData);
    }
```
