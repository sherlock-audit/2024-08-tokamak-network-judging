# Unauthorized Fund Transfers via Manipulated Metadata in `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof`

## Summary
A critical vulnerability exists in the [finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L356) function of the `OptimismPortal2.sol` contract that allows malicious actors to manipulate withdrawal transactions by altering key transaction metadata, specifically the `target address`. This vulnerability enables an attacker to reroute funds intended for legitimate users to an address controlled by the attacker, resulting in unauthorized withdrawal finalizations and potential theft of user funds.

The vulnerability arises because `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` does not adequately validate the source of the transaction or the legitimacy of the target address within the transaction metadata. This lack of validation allows an attacker, such as Bob, to alter the metadata of a legitimate user’s (Alice’s) withdrawal transaction and set the target address to an address controlled by the attacker. As a result, the system processes and finalizes the manipulated transaction, falsely marking it as complete and rerouting funds to the attacker's address without proper authorization.
## Vulnerability Detail
The ` finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function is responsible for finalizing withdrawal transactions from Layer 2 `(L2)` to Layer 1 `(L1)`. The function processes a `WithdrawalTransaction` structure containing details about the withdrawal, including the sender, `target address`, value, and other related data.

The vulnerability arises because `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` does not adequately validate the integrity of the transaction metadata, particularly the `target address`. This absence of validation allows an attacker to intercept and manipulate the transaction data of a legitimate user, altering the `target address` to one that the `attacker controls`.

##Attack:
* The attacker, Bob, observes the blockchain for pending withdrawal transactions, such as Alice’s.
* Bob can see Alice’s `WithdrawalTransaction` details, including the `target address` where funds should be sent.
* Bob creates a modified version of Alice’s transaction, changing the `target address` to his own `(bobControlledAddress)` while keeping other details the same.
* Bob encodes the manipulated `WithdrawalTransaction` data within his malicious contract `(AttackContract)` using the `setMetaData()` function. This step prepares the manipulated metadata for execution.
* Bob calls the `attack()` function on his `AttackContract`, which triggers the `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function using the manipulated metadata.
* Due to the lack of validation in `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof`, the transaction is processed, and the funds are sent to `Bob’s address` instead of  Alice’s.

## Impact
* The system falsely marks the manipulated transaction as finalized, even though the finalization was not triggered by the legitimate user or an authorized source.
* Funds intended for the legitimate user `(Alice)` are redirected to the `attacker’s address`, effectively resulting in theft.
* Once the transaction is marked as finalized, the legitimate user cannot reattempt the withdrawal, causing permanent loss of access to their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Before finalizing any transaction, ensure that the transaction metadata, including the target address, matches the original details provided by the legitimate user.
* Introduce strict validation checks to ensure that finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof can only be called by authorized addresses, specifically verifying the legitimacy of the call against the original transaction initiator.
