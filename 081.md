# bridgeERC20 withdraws get nativeToken stuck on L2

### Summary

Since native token is an ERC20, a user may try to withdraw native token, but using the `bridgeERC20` function. If this happens, tokens get stuck on the L2 and can't be bridged to the L1.

### Root Cause

There's no check that stops a user from calling `bridgeERC20` on the L2 and passing in the ERC20 nativeTokens. This is plausible because these tokens are ERC20s.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user calls `bridgeERC20` on the L2 passing in the native token addresses as the token addresses.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

There's no check that stops a user from calling `bridgeERC20` on the L2 and passing in the ERC20 nativeToken. 

In `_initiateBridgeERC20`, the native token will return false here:

So instead of it being burned, it'll be transferred and state for `deposits` will be updated.

Then, on the L1, when `relayMessage` calls `finalizeBridgeERC20`, the following line will return false:

Then the transaction will revert due to underflow (nativeToken is blocked on deposits if you try to call bridgeERC20, so deposits[nativetoken][nativetoken] will always be 0 on the L1):

### Impact

Loss of funds for withdrawing users of native token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent users from withdrawing native token using `bridgeERC20` or `bridgeERC20To`.
