# Incorrect msg.sender Check in Token Approval Callback

### Summary

Incorrect use of `msg.sender` in the token approval callback will cause the callback to fail for the token contract as any account attempting to approve the token will be rejected since the `msg.sender` will always be the address of the account trying to approve the tokens, not the token contract itself.

### Root Cause

In the code, `require(msg.sender == _nativeTokenAddress, "only accept native token approve callback");`, the root cause is that `msg.sender` is being compared to `_nativeTokenAddress`, expecting the token contract address to call the function, while `msg.sender` in this context will be the address of the account that wants to approve the tokens.

### Impact

The token approval callback will always revert, causing users to be unable to approve tokens for transactions. The affected party is the user attempting to approve tokens, resulting in failed approvals and blocking protocol interactions. There is no financial loss, but the functionality is disrupted.
