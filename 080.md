# User will lost their bridged funds through bridgeNativeToken() in Standardbridge.sol , if user using account abstraction wallet / multisig

## Summary

Users with account abstraction wallets have different addresses across different chains for the same account, so if user using an account abstraction wallet while Bridging Native or ERC20 token or Eth too, the Bridged Token will be minted to the wrong address and lost permanently. And these tokens cannot be recovered back.

## Vulnerability Detail

With 5.7 million users and 79 billion assets, there is a very high risk that the users would be using account abstraction wallet while bridging of tokens and lose all the rewards.

Here, we can see the bridgeNativeToken() function passes the msg.sender as address of from and to and here _from is Address of the sender on L1 and _to is Address of the recipient on L2 chain, assuming that the user has the same address across all the EVM chains; which is not the case if the user is using the account abstraction wallet.


Then, on the l2, After finalizing the Bridged tokens will be minted to the l1 chain's account abstraction wallet address, but on l2 chain, the same person will not be the owner of that address; hence, all rewards are permanently lost.


## Impact

If user's bridging Native or ERC20 token using an account abstraction wallet, the rewards will be minted to the wrong address and lost permanently.

You should not hardcode the destination chain address means _to address should not be msg.sender , you should ask for user input for his recieving address. Also consider case when bridgeNativeTokenTo() , which is intended for transfering to different user, so if user transfering to his own will not use To() function, he will use bridgeNativeToken() only, as he will be not aware of the code and he will transfer to self only. he will use other function only when he will trasfer to different user. This could lead to direct loss of funds to user, and it can be very critical. So in input address should be taken ( in function to deposit to self and deposit to other both ) . means common function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

_to address should be taken as a input parameter. in  both cases while bridging to self or bridging to other user. And if possible single function should be there. and reciever address should be asked from user only. so it will not confuse them. and notification and warning for these types of wallet from frontend should be there. As it is protocol responsibility as user are in very large number and we should assume they would have known that.
