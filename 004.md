# Some standard tokens will always revert when calling the `approve` function with 0 amount

### Summary

Some tokens like the `BNB` token, will always revert if you call their `approve()` function with 0 amount.

According to the contest [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L15) file, the `BNB` token is in scope since:

1. It has 18 decimals.
2. Doesn't have fee on transfers.
3. Is not rebasing or has double entry points.


### Root Cause

Taken from the ([BNB Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8c77482e45f1f44de1745f52c74426c631bdd52#code)):

```js
    /* Allow another contract to spend some tokens in your behalf */
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)
        returns (bool success) {
@>      if (_value <= 0) throw;
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        return true;
    }
```

This happens multiple times in the protocol:

[L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L306):

```js
    function relayMessage(
        uint256 _nonce,
        address _sender,
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _minGasLimit,
        bytes calldata _message
    )
        external
        payable
        override
    {
        require(paused() == false, "L1 CrossDomainMessenger: paused");
        .
        .
        .
        // _target is expected to perform a transferFrom to collect token
        bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, 0, _message);
        if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
@>          IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, 0);
        }
        .
        .
```

[OptimismPortal2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L413):

```js
    /// @notice Finalizes a withdrawal transaction, using an external proof submitter.
    /// @param _tx Withdrawal transaction to finalize.
    /// @param _proofSubmitter Address of the proof submitter.
    function finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        address _proofSubmitter
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Make sure that the l2Sender has not yet been set. The l2Sender is set to a value other
        // than the default value when a withdrawal transaction is being finalized. This check is
        // a defacto reentrancy guard.
        require(
            l2Sender == Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER, "OptimismPortal: can only trigger one withdrawal per transaction"
        );
        .
        .
        .
        // Reset approval after a call
        if (_tx.data.length != 0 && _tx.value != 0) {
@>          IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_tx.target, 0);
        }
        .
        .
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Always when the `OptimismPortal2::proveWithdrawalTransaction()` or `L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage()` functions are called.

### Impact

A standard ERC20 token like `BNB` can't be used as a gas token. Doing so will result in the transactions always reverting.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure you always closely review the ERC20s chosen as gas tokens and don't allow such tokens since they will break the protocol.
