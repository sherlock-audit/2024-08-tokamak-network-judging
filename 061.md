# Bridges can be frontrun by malicious actors

### Summary

Bridges can be frontrun by malicious actors and change the address on the destination chain to its address. Front running can be done either by sending a tx with a higher gas price (usually tx are ordered in a block by the gas price / total fee), or by paying an additional fee to the validator if they manage to run their tx without reverting.

When a user bridges, there are 2 main stages, the first is transferring the token and the second is sending a message that functions to execute the function on the destination chain. The thing that can cause all bridges to be hit by a frontrun attack is that the main function `CrossDomainMessanger::sendMessage()` has no modifier or in other words, everyone can call that function, crafting a message from the user who bridges and changing the destination address to their own, then sending a message to finalize the bridge process on the destination chain. 

This applies to all tokens and also applies to bridges from L1 to L2 or from L2 to L1 :

1. ETH
2. ERC20 
3. Native Token

### Root Cause

*In [CrossDomainMessenger.sol:176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L176) there is a missing modifier for anyone who can call this function*

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

ERC20 bridge as an example from L1 to L2 :

1. Alice call `bridgeERC20()` / `bridgeERC20To()`, then continued with the `_initiateBridgeERC20()` function 
2. Bob as a malicious actor listens to mempool in order to check if he sees a tx of Alice bridge
3. Then Bob calls the `CrossDomainMessanger::sendMessage()` function on the source chain, crafts all the data Alice gave, and replaces the destination address on the destination chain with the address he has
4. Bob pays a higher gas price so that his tx is executed before `sendMessage` on Alice's tx.
5. Bob can finalize on the destination chain and get the tokens bridged by Alice.

### Impact

User loses all the tokens she / he bridged

### PoC

```solidity
    function sendMessage(address _target, bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) external payable {
```

### Mitigation

Consider adding modifiers on `CrossDomainMessanger::sendMessage()` (i.e `onlyBridge`)
