# Fund in portal or messager can be stolen in case native token changes

## Summary

Fund can be stolen in case native token changes.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L382

when the withdraw is finalized, the code intentionally check if [the _tx.target is _nativeTokenAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L382)

```solidity
    address _nativeTokenAddress = _nativeToken();

    // Not allow to call native token contract because users can transfer all token out of the contract
    require(
        _tx.target != _nativeTokenAddress, "Optimism Portal: cannot make a direct call to native token contract"
    );
```

this is important because without this check, user can set _tx.target as _nativeTokenAddress and trigger transfer function to transfer all fund out from the portal.

Same case for the cross-chain domain messager because the contract hold the native token fund because the relay transaction is completed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L257

```solidity
if (_isOtherMessenger()) {
        // These properties should always hold when the message is first submitted (as
        // opposed to being replayed).
        assert(!failedMessages[versionedHash]);
        if (_value > 0) {
            IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(address(portal), address(this), _value);
        }
    }
```

However, if the native token address is updated or changed in the system config,

the  _tx.target != _nativeTokenAddress check is not sufficient and all old native token in the contract can be stolen.

consider the case:

1. the native token is TOKENMAK, the optimism portal hold 1 mililion TOKNENMAK.
2. the native token is changed to THANOS, then all the TOKENMAK in portal or message can be stolen.
3. user can set the target to TOKNENMAK and trigger transfer method call data to transfer the fund out because the THANOS is the new native token.

> Not all tokens can be chosen as the L2 native token. For a token to be used as an L2 native token, the corresponding L1 token must satisfy the ERC20 standard and the following additional requirements:

> Has 18 decimals. The L2 native token has 18 decimals, so the corresponding L1 token must have exactly 18 decimals to ensure no loss of precision when depositing or withdrawing.

so it can be infered  that there can be more than one native token.

## Impact

loss of fund when updating the native address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the check

```solidity
_tx.target != _nativeTokenAddress
```

is not sufficient, the code should track a list of  _nativeTokenAddress used

and validate that _tx.target is not in the list of _nativeTokenAddress
