# Gas Abuse in Cross-Chain Messaging

## Summary
The current implementation of gas calculation for cross-chain messaging in Optimism allows for potential abuse. Users could send messages with minimal value transfer but cause the protocol to use a disproportionately large amount of gas.
## Vulnerability Detail
The baseGas function calculates the gas required for message relay, including several overhead factors. A user can manipulate this by sending a message with a small value but a large _minGasLimit, causing the protocol to reserve more gas than necessary.

Let's consider a scenario where a user sends a minimal value transaction but with a large _minGasLimit:

1. Assumptions:

  * _message.length = 100 bytes
  * _minGasLimit = 1,000,000 gas


2. Calculation:
``` python
baseGas = 200,000                            // RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD
        + (100 * 16)                         // Calldata overhead
        + ((1,000,000 * 64) / 63)            // Dynamic overhead
        + 40,000                             // RELAY_CALL_OVERHEAD
        + 40,000                             // RELAY_RESERVED_GAS
        + 5,000                              // RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER
        = 200,000 + 1,600 + 1,015,873 + 40,000 + 40,000 + 5,000
        = 1,302,473 gas
```
3.Analysis:

* The user's transaction might only require a fraction of the 1,000,000 gas limit.
* The protocol reserves 1,302,473 gas, which is significantly more than likely needed.
* The ratio of useful work to gas reserved is very low, potentially less than 1%.

## Impact
Impact

1. Increased costs for the protocol or relayers
2. Potential DoS if gas limits are reached
4. Inefficient use of L1 resources
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function baseGas(bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) public pure returns (uint64) {
    return
    RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD
    + (uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD)
    + ((_minGasLimit * MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR) / MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_DENOMINATOR)
    + RELAY_CALL_OVERHEAD
    + RELAY_RESERVED_GAS
    + RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER;
}
