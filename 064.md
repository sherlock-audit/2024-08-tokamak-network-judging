# No validation of resolveData allowing an attacker to resolve challenges with invalid data and earn locked funds.

### Summary

No validation of the users-defined input data (resolveData) is done in 'DataAvailabilityChallenge:: resolve' function as shown below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/DataAvailabilityChallenge.sol#L335C4-L371C6

Whatever the resolveData is, the bytes length is used to calculate the resolution cost which also determines the reward of the resolver. This function can easily be exploited by any user to consistently resolve challenges with long bytes invalid data and earn rewards.

### Root Cause

No validation of the users-defined input data (resolveData) is done in 'DataAvailabilityChallenge:: resolve' function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

### Impact

All challenges will be resolved with long invalid data by any user so all the lockedbond will be sent to the user (resolver)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate the content of the user input resolveData in 'DataAvailabilityChallenge:: resolve' function.
