# Attacker will mint more tokens on L2 than deposited on L1

### Summary

The missing validation between deposited and minted token amounts in `OptimismPortal2._depositTransaction` will cause a significant loss of funds for the protocol as an attacker will mint more tokens on L2 than they actually deposit on L1 through either the `onApprove` callback or direct `depositTransaction` call on the `OptimismPortal2` contract.

### Root Cause

In `OptimismPortal2.sol`, the `_depositTransaction` function, which is called by both `onApprove` and `depositTransaction`, does not validate that the `_value` parameter (amount to be minted on L2) is equal to the `_mint` parameter (amount transferred on L1). This allows for a mismatch between deposited and minted token amounts.

This can happen when using the `OptimismPortal2` without going through the bridge or messenger, looking at the messenger code we can see that the two parameters are assumed equal.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker chooses either to use `approveAndCall` on the native token contract or to directly call `depositTransaction` on `OptimismPortal2`.
2. If using approveAndCall:

- Attacker approves a small amount (or zero tokens) to `OptimismPortal2` by calling `nativeTOken.approveAndCall(..., data)`.
- In the `data` parameter, attacker specifies a much larger `value`.
- The `OptimismPortal2.onApprove` will extract the `value` from the user specified `data` and call `_depositTransaction`

3. If using depositTransaction:

- Attacker directly calls the function with a small `_mint` value and a larger `_value`.
- The _depositTransaction function is called.
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L498

4. The `_depositTransaction` will get called which will 
- Transfer `_mint` amount from the user
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L530
- Send `_value` amount to the L2 receiver
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L554
- Emits `TransactionDeposited` event
- The L2 system processes this deposit event and mints tokens based on the larger `_value` in the opaque data.
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/op-node/rollup/derive/deposit_log.go#L114

### Impact

The protocol suffers a significant loss of funds. Attackers can mint arbitrary amounts of tokens on L2 while depositing only a small amount (or potentially zero) on L1. The attacker gains the difference between the deposited amount and the minted amount on L2.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `_depositTransaction` function in `OptimismPortal2` to ensure that the `_value` parameter (amount to be minted on L2) equals the `_mint` parameter.
