# Address Aliasing Mismanagement in `depositTransaction` Leading to Potential Loss of Funds

## Summary
The `depositTransaction` function in the `OptimismPortal` contract can lead to a situation where funds appear to be lost when the function is called by a contract rather than an Externally Owned Account (EOA). This occurs due to the address aliasing mechanism, which modifies the sender's address to prevent replay attacks. If the receiving contract on L2 is not designed to handle aliased addresses, it not recognize the sender, resulting in inaccessible funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the `depositTransaction` function where the sender's address is aliased if the caller is a contract. This is implemented using the `AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias` function.
```solidity
490:     function depositTransaction(
491:         address _to,
492:         uint256 _value,
493:         uint64 _gasLimit,
494:         bool _isCreation,
495:         bytes memory _data
496:     )
497:         public
498:         payable
499:         metered(_gasLimit)
500:     {
501:         (address token,) = gasPayingToken();
502:         if (token != Constants.ETHER && msg.value != 0) revert NoValue();
---
504:         _depositTransaction({
505:             _to: _to,
506:             _mint: msg.value,
507:             _value: _value,
508:             _gasLimit: _gasLimit,
509:             _isCreation: _isCreation,
510:             _data: _data
511:         });
512:     }
---
521:     function _depositTransaction(
522:         address _to,
523:         uint256 _mint,
524:         uint256 _value,
525:         uint64 _gasLimit,
526:         bool _isCreation,
527:         bytes memory _data
528:     )
529:         internal
530:     {
---
533:         if (_isCreation && _to != address(0)) revert BadTarget();
---
537:         if (_gasLimit < minimumGasLimit(uint64(_data.length))) revert SmallGasLimit();
---
543:         if (_data.length > 120_000) revert LargeCalldata();
---
546:         address from = msg.sender;
547:@=>      if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
548:             from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
549:         }
---
554:         bytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(_mint, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data);
---
558:         emit TransactionDeposited(from, _to, DEPOSIT_VERSION, opaqueData);
559:     }
```
The address aliasing occurs within the `if (msg.sender != tx.origin)` block. This logic changes the from address to an aliased version if the caller is a contract.

## Impact
If the receiving contract on L2 does not account for the aliased address, it not process the transaction correctly, leading to funds being inaccessible or appearing "lost."

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Provide a utility function or pattern for L2 contracts to handle aliased addresses.
```diff
+ function isAliasedSender(address _sender, address _expected) internal pure returns (bool) {
+   return _sender == AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(_expected);
}
```
