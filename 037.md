# finalizeBridgeETH() and finalizeBridgeERC20() Functions Fail Because xDomainMsgSender variable Remains at Default Value

### Summary

The finalizeBridgeETH() and finalizeBridgeERC20() functions in the contract are consistently reverting due to an issue with the onlyOtherBridge modifier, which relies on the xDomainMessageSender() function to verify the sender's identity. The xDomainMessageSender() function checks whether the variable xDomainMsgSender is set to a valid address. However, xDomainMsgSender is always initialized to Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER and never updated throughout the contract, leading to the failure of the require statement that checks its value. As a result, every time finalizeBridgeETH() or finalizeBridgeERC20() is called, the transaction reverts, effectively blocking any asset transfer operations that rely on these functions. This issue highlights the need for a mechanism to properly set xDomainMsgSender to a valid address before these functions can be successfully executed, as currently, users cannot complete essential transactions due to this unintentional limitation.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the xDomainMsgSender variable is always set to Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER and there is no mechanism within the contract to update or modify this value. This causes the require statement in the xDomainMessageSender() function to fail every time it is called. As a result, any function that relies on the onlyOtherBridge modifier, such as finalizeBridgeETH() and finalizeBridgeERC20(), will always revert, because the modifier depends on xDomainMessageSender() to verify the sender. Without a valid xDomainMsgSender being set, the require check will always fail, preventing the functions from executing.

Although xDomainMsgSender is temporarily set to another address (such as _sender) during execution of relayMessage(), but it is immediately reset to Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER right after the call.

        xDomainMsgSender = _sender;
        bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, _value, _message);
        xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract must be in a state where finalizeBridgeETH() or finalizeBridgeERC20() can be called.

### External pre-conditions

The contract must be deployed and interactable on the appropriate network.

### Attack Path

A user attempts to execute finalizeBridgeETH() or finalizeBridgeERC20().
The onlyOtherBridge modifier is invoked.
Within the modifier, xDomainMessageSender() is called.
The require statement in xDomainMessageSender() fails because xDomainMsgSender equals Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER.
The transaction is reverted

### Impact

This issue renders the bridge functionality inoperable, preventing users from completing essential operations. It could lead to significant disruption for users relying on the bridge for transferring assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a setter function to allow for xDomainMsgSender to be set to a valid address during the contract's lifecycle.
