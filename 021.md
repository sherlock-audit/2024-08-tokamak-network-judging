# DoS in `relayMessage` function

## Summary
Some tokens, such as `BNB`, exhibit non-standard behavior where they revert when `approving a zero` value amount `(approve(address, 0))`. This can lead to unexpected failures in smart contracts that assume standard `ERC20` approval behavior.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [relayMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L222) function in the `L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol` contract attempts to approve tokens for transfer using the approve function of the ERC20 standard. However, certain tokens, including `BNB`, are known to revert when approving a zero value amount, which deviates from the expected ERC20 behavior.
## Impact
Cause the `relayMessage` function to revert unexpectedly, disrupting the normal workflow.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
    IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, 0); <---
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Integrators working with such tokens needs to add special cases to handle this behavior to avoid reverts and ensure smooth operation.
