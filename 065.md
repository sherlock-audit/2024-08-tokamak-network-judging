# `Gasgriefing` due to lack of check for paused contract in `L1StandardBridge.sol` and `L2StandardBridge.sol`

## Summary
Users, suffer gas griefing due to lack of passability check in key functionalities of the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The bug affects `bridgeEth`, `bridgeNativeToken` and `bridgeERC20` functions on the `L1StandardBridge.sol`contract and `withdraw/withdrawTo` functions in L2StandardBridge`. The bug here is that these functions and their internal implementation does not check for if the contract or it's equivalent on the other chain is paused before passing the `message` to the other `chain` this causes users to waste their gas if the contract is `paused` on the other chain.This is possible because the `finalizeBridgeETH/finalizeBrideERC20/finalizeBrideNativeToken` functions on L2StandardBridge.sol checks if the contract is paused and reverts if the contract is paused. This is also obtainable with finalizeWithdrawal function on L1StandardBridge.sol contract.
## Impact
Loss of funds through gas griefing.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for if the contract is paused before passing the message to the other chain through the crossDomainMessenger.sol. this can be done using the `whenNotPaused` modifier or using a `require` statement as already used in the contracts
```solidity
require(paused() == false, "StandardBridge: paused");
```
