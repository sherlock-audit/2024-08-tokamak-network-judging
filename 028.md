# H1 - Wrong implementation of upgradeable Initializable.sol in L1CrossDomainMessenger

## Summary
In the Contract L1CrossDomainMessenger, the function initialize is called in the Constructor, so variables _superchainConfig, _portal, _systemConfig won't be stored in the proxy but only in the implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail
In an upgradeable contract, this information needs to be stored in the proxy's storage variables, not the implementation's storage variables if L1CrossDomainMessenger is intended to be upgradeable.

## Impact
Adding a constructor is not a good solution because it is error-prone to align the storage variable locations between the proxy and the implementation. Creating a constructor in the implementation won't work because it will set the storage variables of _superchainConfig, _portal, _systemConfig in the implementation of L1CrossDomainMessenger.

## Code Snippet
```javascript 
 /// @notice Constructs the L1CrossDomainMessenger contract.
    constructor() CrossDomainMessenger() {
@>     initialize({
            _superchainConfig: SuperchainConfig(address(0)),
            _portal: OptimismPortal(payable(address(0))),
            _systemConfig: SystemConfig(address(0))
        });
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent the implementation contract from being used, invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to lock it when it is deployed automatically.
and remove the function initialize from teh constructor of L1CrossDomainMessenger
