# Lack of Access Control in `finalizeDeposit`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `finalizeDeposit` function is `external` and `payable` but lacks any access control modifiers like `onlyOtherBridge`.
- This means any user can call `finalizeDeposit` directly, bypassing the intended message relay via the `CrossDomainMessenger`.
- Within `finalizeDeposit`, depending on the token addresses provided, it calls one of the following functions:
  - `finalizeBridgeNativeToken`
  - `finalizeBridgeETH`
  - `finalizeBridgeERC20`
- Although these functions have the `onlyOtherBridge` modifier, an attacker can manipulate the parameters to bypass these checks.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Direct Invocation:**
   - An attacker calls `finalizeDeposit` directly, providing parameters that avoid hitting the `onlyOtherBridge` modifier in the called functions.
   - By carefully choosing `_l1Token` and `_l2Token` addresses, they might reach a code path that allows token minting or transfers without proper authorization.

2. **Parameter Manipulation:**
   - The attacker sets `_l1Token` and `_l2Token` to addresses that are not correctly handled in the `if` conditions.
   - Since the `finalizeDeposit` function lacks a default `else` condition to revert, it might allow unintended execution paths.

## Impact

- **Unauthorized Token Minting:**
  - The attacker could mint tokens on L2 without a corresponding deposit on L1.
- **Unauthorized Transfers:**
  - Funds could be transferred to the attacker without proper authorization.
- **Bypassing Cross-Domain Security:**
  - The core security model relies on messages being relayed securely via the `CrossDomainMessenger`. This vulnerability undermines that model.
