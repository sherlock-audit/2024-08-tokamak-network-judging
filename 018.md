# `OptimismPortal2` contract accepts ETH deposits which breaks an invariant of the protocol

## Summary
As it can be seen [here](https://tokamak.notion.site/L2-native-token-specification-4ba8b138747f4981a2ce4c5a0f595964#a37acf5de82c46e1b6ae9d8ca2ebe657) that the protocol wants to restrict deposit of ETH to `OptimismPortal2` contract. However, the protocol forgot to restrict the `donateETH()` function which allows deposit of ETH to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
It can be seen [here](https://tokamak.notion.site/L2-native-token-specification-4ba8b138747f4981a2ce4c5a0f595964#a37acf5de82c46e1b6ae9d8ca2ebe657), that the protocol wants to block deposits of ETH to OptimismPortal2 contract.
> receive MUST revert because depositing ETH is not supported, only depositing L2 native token is supported.

Also contest readme states the design choices:

> 2. We use only one function for deposit assets in `OptimismPortal2`. Custom Gas Token uses `depositTransaction` and `depositERC20Transaction`. `OptimismPortal2.sol::depositTransaction(address _to, uint256 _mint, uint256 _value, uint64 _gasLimit, bool _isCreation, bytes calldata _data)`


However, after restricting `receive` function they mistakenly left `donateETH` function untouched, which should also be restricted to prevent ETH deposits. Any deposited ETH is forever locked in the contract.

[Optimism v1.7.7 code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/v1.7.7/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L230-L239):
```javascript
    receive() external payable {
        depositTransaction(msg.sender, msg.value, RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT, false, bytes(""));
    }
...
    function donateETH() external payable {
        // Intentionally empty.
    }
```

[Tokamak code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L246-L256):
```javascript
    receive() external payable {
        revert("Only allow native token");
        // depositTransaction(msg.sender, msg.value, RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT, false, bytes(""));
    }
...
    function donateETH() external payable {
        // Intentionally empty.
    }
```

## Impact
High - Invariant/protocol design break as anyone can deposit ETH to OptimismPortal2 contract. Locking of funds, however this is a result of user mistake.

Overall severity should be Medium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict `donateETH` function to block deposits or remove it.
