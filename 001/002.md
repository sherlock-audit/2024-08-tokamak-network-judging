# Cross Domain Messengers Can Fail in Relaying a Message

## Summary
The [L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol) contract can fail to relay messages due to insufficient gas estimation. The added logic in the [relayMessage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L222-L327) function introduces extra gas consumption that exceeds the predefined gas buffers. This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) conditions where valid messages fail to be relayed, and users' funds may become stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.so) contract extends `CrossDomainMessenger` and overrides the `relayMessage` function. In the overridden function, additional operations are introduced, specifically involving approve calls to handle native token transfers:
```solidity
// Approve the target to spend the native token amount
if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
    IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, _value);
}

// External call to the target contract
bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, 0, _message);

// Reset the approval after the external call
if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
    IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, 0);
}
```
These `approve` calls consume additional gas, potentially up to `40,000` units each, depending on the ERC20 token implementation. The original gas estimation constants in `CrossDomainMessenger` are:
```solidity
uint64 public constant RELAY_RESERVED_GAS = 40_000;
uint64 public constant RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER = 5_000;
```
The `hasMinGas` function, responsible for ensuring there's enough gas to proceed, uses these constants:
```solidity
if (
    !SafeCall.hasMinGas(_minGasLimit, RELAY_RESERVED_GAS + RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER)
        || xDomainMsgSender != Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER
) {
    failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
    emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);
    // Revert logic...
    return;
}
```
The added gas consumption from the approve calls exceeds the predefined gas buffers (`RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` and `RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER`), leading to situations where `relayMessage` fails due to insufficient gas.

## Impact
1. Denial of Service (DoS): Valid messages may fail to be relayed, disrupting cross-domain communication.
2. Stuck Funds: Users' funds associated with the message could become locked if the message cannot be successfully relayed.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Increase `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` to account for the additional gas consumed by the approve calls. For example, if each `approve` call can consume up to `40,000` gas units, and there are two such calls, set `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` to at least `90,000` units and `RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER` to `55,000` units :
 ```solidity
uint64 public constant RELAY_RESERVED_GAS = 90_000;
uint64 public constant RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER = 55_000;
   ```
