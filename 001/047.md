# `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` may be insufficient for post-call processing on Cross Domain Messenger

# `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` may be insufficient for post-call processing on Cross Domain Messenger

### Severity

High

### Summary

The `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` value in the Cross Domain Messenger has not been adjusted to account for the additional `nativeToken.approve()` call that was added between the call and the end of the function. As a result, it is possible for the reserved gas to be insufficient, causing withdrawals to fail without replayability and lose user funds.

### Root Cause

When a withdrawal message is processed through the Portal to the Cross Domain Messenger, it is absolutely critical that it does not revert without setting the `failedMessages` mapping. Otherwise, the safety and replayability guarantees of the Cross Domain Messenger will be broken.

Optimism achieves this by ensuring that at `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` is reserved after the call, by sending the message with [the following logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L304):

```solidity
bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, 0, _message);
```
(Note that this check doesn't exactly guarantee that `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` is left, because of the 63/64th rule, but given additional previous checks, it is intended to provide this guarantee.)

Specifically, `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` is set to `40_000`, which must be enough to perform [the remaining logic in the function after the call finishes execution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L305-L318):
```solidity
if (_value != 0 && _target != address(0)) {
    IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).approve(_target, 0);
}
xDomainMsgSender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

if (success) {
    // This check is identical to the one above, but it ensures that the same message cannot be relayed
    // twice, and adds a layer of protection against reentrancy.
    assert(successfulMessages[versionedHash] == false);
    successfulMessages[versionedHash] = true;
    emit RelayedMessage(versionedHash);
} else {
    failedMessages[versionedHash] = true;
    emit FailedRelayedMessage(versionedHash);

    // Revert in this case if the transaction was triggered by the estimation address. This
    // should only be possible during gas estimation or we have bigger problems. Reverting
    // here will make the behavior of gas estimation change such that the gas limit
    // computed will be the amount required to relay the message, even if that amount is
    // greater than the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
    if (tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
        revert("CrossDomainMessenger: failed to relay message");
    }
}
```
In Optimism's case, there was no call to `nativeToken.approve()`, so the `40_000` value was set to cover the `xDomainMsgSender` value reset, the single `SSTORE` in one of the mappings, and some other odds and ends.

With Thanos' changes, we add a call to `nativeToken.approve()`. Given the approval is setting the value to `0`, in most cases, this will not use sufficient gas to cause an out of gas error. However, it is not uncommong for certain tokens to have additional hooks or actions in their functions, and even one additional `SSTORE` in its execution would cause the `40_000` gas to be insufficient.

In the event that such a token is used as the native token, an attacker could call `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` with an amount of gas that is sufficient for execution, but leaves only `40_000` gas remaining afterwards, and it would revert and permanently lose the withdrawers funds.

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The native token uses more than 6451 gas (a single SSTORE) when `nativeToken.approve(target, 0)` is called.
2. An attacker calls `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` and passes the minimum acceptable amount of gas.
3. All gas is used according to the expectations, and we are left with 40_000 (`RELAY_RESERVED_GAS`) gas for execution after the call.
4. The call to approve uses too much gas that the execution cannot complete, so the call reverts and the withdrawal is permanently bricked.

### Impact

If the native token uses a modest 6451 gas when `nativeToken.approve(to, 0)` is called, an attacker can permanently brick withdrawals, losing user funds.

### PoC

The following test demonstrates the issue. A modified Cross Domain Messenger is used to emulate execution with `40_000` gas left after an external call.

The call reverting from the test with an `OutOfGas` error shows that we will not be able to complete the logic with the `40_000` gas.

```

### Mitigation

Increase the `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` value to account for the additional gas usage in the `nativeToken.approve()` call. Additionally, ensure there is a strict requirement on native tokens that they cannot in any case use more gas than expected for this call.
