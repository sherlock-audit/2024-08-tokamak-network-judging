# `L11CrossDomainMessenger::sendMessage()` doesn't check `_minGasLimit`.

## Summary
Users can set `_minGasLimit` arbitrarily high and `sendMessage()` doesn't check it's validity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calling `sendMessage()`, users have to prepay gas fee for the transaction of the other chain. Users can set `_minGasLimit` arbitrarily high and `sendMessage()` doesn't check it's validity. So users set `_minGasLimit` arbitrarily high while they don't pay for it by ETH or native token.

The relavant code of `CrossDomainMessenger::sendMessage()` is the following.
```solidity
    function sendMessage(address _target, bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) external payable {
        // Triggers a message to the other messenger. Note that the amount of gas provided to the
        // message is the amount of gas requested by the user PLUS the base gas value. We want to
        // guarantee the property that the call to the target contract will always have at least
        // the minimum gas limit specified by the user.
        _sendMessage({
            _to: address(otherMessenger),
            _gasLimit: baseGas(_message, _minGasLimit),
            _value: msg.value,
            _data: abi.encodeWithSelector(
                this.relayMessage.selector, messageNonce(), msg.sender, _target, msg.value, _minGasLimit, _message
            )
        });

        emit SentMessage(_target, msg.sender, _message, messageNonce(), _minGasLimit);
        emit SentMessageExtension1(msg.sender, msg.value);

        unchecked {
            ++msgNonce;
        }
    }
```
As shown above, the function doesn't check `_minGasLimit` against `msg.value` and also doesn't transfer native tokens of `_minGasLimit` to the contract. Therefore, the user can set `_minGasLimit` arbitrarily high while they don't pay for it at all.

POC:
1. User calls `CrossDomainMessenger::sendMessage()` while set `_minGasLimit` arbitrarily high for heavy transaction on other chain. But user doesn't pay for it by ETH or native token at the same time.
2. The protocol doesn't check `_minGasLimit`. And op node will relay the transaction to the other chain while pay gas fee by itself.

## Impact
User can call `sendMessage()` on L2 and executes the transaction on L1 without paying any gas fee. In ethereum(L1), the gas fee is very expensive. So it causes the protocol to lose much funds.
Loss of funds for the protocol.
