# L2 to L1 messages to a `fallback()` function will be skipped

### Summary

When a withdrawal message is sent from L2 to L1 that does not contain any data or value, the call is skipped instead of being executed. While the most common reasons for a transaction are to send value or data, this precludes the ability to call a contract's `fallback()` function, which should be expected to work.

### Root Cause

In `OptimismPortal2.sol`, a finalized transaction is performed with [the following logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L404-L409):
```solidity
if (_tx.data.length != 0) {
    success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_tx.target, _tx.gasLimit, 0, _tx.data);
} else {
    success = true;
}
```
Additionally, if there is `value` but no `data`, we perform the following:
```solidity
IERC20(_nativeTokenAddress).safeTransfer(_tx.target, _tx.value);
```

However, in the event that there is no `value` and no `data`, the transaction is skipped entirely (as you can see in the `success = true` above).

While it is rare that such a transaction will be sent through the bridge, the inability for a valid bridged transaction to be processed on L1 could cause problems.

### Internal Preconditions

None

### External Preconditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user sends an empty transaction from L2 to L1, with a target that is expecting to receive it.
2. After `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction()` is called, nothing happens.

### Impact

Users can send L2 to L1 messages that comply with the bridge's rules and will simply not be executed.

### PoC

Here is a dummy example of a contract that expects an empty call from L2 in order to start some process. While the L2 portion of the transaction would work fine, the L1 execution would be skipped, and the contract could not be started.
```solidity
contract L2Listener {
    fallback() external {
        require(msg.sender == portal, "portal only");
        require(msg.data.length == 0, "not trying to call another function");

        started = true;
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

If there is no `value` and no `data`, perform the call on L1 as expected.
