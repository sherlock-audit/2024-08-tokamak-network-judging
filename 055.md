# Unverified Cross-Chain Token and Messages Allow Manipulation and Financial Loss

## Summary
The `StandardBridge.sol` and `CrossDomainMessenger.sol` contracts are vulnerable to exploitation due to the lack of verification for the sender of cross-chain messages or tokens. This allows any user to send arbitrary tokens along with fraudulent data to the `StandardBridge.sol` contract on the destination chain, which is then processed as if it were legitimate. 

## Vulnerability Detail

L1 and L2 contracts interact with the `StandardBridge.sol` contract to receive native and ERC20 tokens, as well as cross-chain data. When tokens are bridged, the `sendMessage` function of the `CrossDomainMessenger.sol` contract is invoked. The `sendMessage` function handles the tokens and associated data by calling the `finalizeBridgeERC20` function and the `relayMessage` function.

However, the `sendMessage` function does not verify the sender of the cross-chain message (or the received tokens).

This allows anyone to send any tokens along with arbitrary data to the `StandardBridge.sol` contract on the other chain. Then, the `relayMessage` function in the `CrossDomainMessenger.sol` contract will process the data, assuming it represents valid staking targets and incentives.

An attacker can bridge any tokens to the `StandardBridge.sol` contract on the other chain using fake data to manipulate staking incentives. Since the `StandardBridge.sol` contract does not seem to provide a way to access the original senderâ€™s address on the source chain when executing the receiver callback after receiving the tokens, the most sensible mitigation approach may be to send the bridged tokens and associated staking data separately.

## Impact
An attacker can bridge arbitrary tokens along with fake staking data to the `StandardBridge.sol` contract on the target chain. The `CrossDomainMessenger.sol` contract will then process the message without verifying the origin, potentially allowing malicious actors to manipulate staking incentives. This could result in significant financial loss, as tokens could be redistributed to incorrect staking targets, or manipulated in ways that drain funds from the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to separate the token transfer from the message transfer, so that it is no longer necessary to call `finalizeBridgeERC20` in the `sendMessage` function.
