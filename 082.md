# The unsafe token-to-validation process

## Summary

In the _initiateBridgeERC20 function, for tokens that are not OptimismMintableERC20, the pairing relationship between _remoteToken and _localToken is not adequately validated. This may lead to the following issues:

## Vulnerability Detail

• For non-OptimismMintableERC20 tokens, there is no verification to ensure that _localToken and _remoteToken are correctly paired.
• An attacker could provide an arbitrary _remoteToken address, causing the wrong token to be received on the target chain.

## Impact

• Token Loss or Locking: Users may receive incorrect tokens on the target chain, leading to loss of tokens or making them unrecoverable.
• Fraudulent Transfers: Attackers could trick users into bridging tokens to a malicious token contract controlled by the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation to the _initiateBridgeERC20 function to verify the pairing relationship between _localToken and _remoteToken.
• Maintain a trusted token pair mapping, allowing only token pairs within the mapping to be bridged.
