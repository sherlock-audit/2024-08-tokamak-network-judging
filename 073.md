# Base gas is not updated which will lead to failed l2 -> l1 message

### Summary

The [CrossDomainMessenger::baseGas()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L343) function calculates the necessary gas to ensure the message relayed in the l1 has at least the specified amount in the l2 when the message was sent. However, the `OptimismPortal::finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof()` adds a few external calls (2 approvals or 1 transfer) and `L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage()` also pulls token from the Optimism portal, which means the base gas will be higher than the previous.

As the value of the `RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD`, `RELAY_RESERVED_GAS` and `RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER` remains the same, the l1 message may not have enough gas to proceed.

### Root Cause

In `Constants.sol:96` the `RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD` is not updated.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `CrossDomainMessenger::sendMessage()` with some gas in the l2.
2. Once the transaction is sent in the l1, `OptimismPortal::finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof()`, it will not have enough gas and revert. It may be possible to replay it later if there was still enough gas to store it in the failed messages mapping. Otherwise it will be impossible to replay.

### Impact

Failed message that may or may not be replayed. Either way, the message may be time sensitive from the protocol. As the gas constants were not updated, it may underestimate the amount of gas needed to finish execution in `L1CrossDomainMessenger::relayMessage(), and the message is not stored in `failedMessages[versionedHash]`, leading to forever stuck funds.

### PoC

See the changes to OptimismPortal and L1CrossDomainMessenger.

### Mitigation

Update the base gas value to account for the extra calls.
