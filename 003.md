# Incorrect Calldata Gas Estimation Could Lead to Some Deposits Failing Unexpectedly

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits funds to the `L1StandardBridge` the resulting 'depositTransaction' has an expected gas fee on L2 calculated by [CrossDomainMessenger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L343-L360): : `baseGas()`. 

In the [baseGas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-tokamak-network/blob/main/tokamak-thanos/packages/tokamak/contracts-bedrock/src/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L343-L360) calculation, the expected cost for the calldata is calculated as:

```solidity

(uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD) + // messageLength * 16
```
This calculation only covers the gas for calldata during the execution of L2CrossDomainManager: : relayMessage()' but not the second call to the '_target' address on L2. This could result in unexpected L1 -> L2 deposit failures which could cost users extra gas spending and delays on successful deposits.

//..SNIP...
```solidity

 bool success = SafeCall.call(_target, gasleft() - RELAY_RESERVED_GAS, 0, _message);
 ```
 Also,
```solidity 

    function baseGas(bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) public pure returns (uint64) {
        return
        // Constant overhead
        RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD
        // Calldata overhead
        + (uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD)
        // Dynamic overhead (EIP-150)
        + ((_minGasLimit * MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR) / MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_DENOMINATOR)
        // Gas reserved for the worst-case cost of 3/5 of the `CALL` opcode's dynamic gas
        // factors. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_CALL_OVERHEAD
        // Relay reserved gas (to ensure execution of `relayMessage` completes after the
        // subcontext finishes executing) (Conservative)
        + RELAY_RESERVED_GAS
        // Gas reserved for the execution between the `hasMinGas` check and the `CALL`
        // opcode. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER;
    }

```
When a message is relayed, it is hashed using functions like hashCrossDomainMessageV1. Hashing messages consumes additional gas proportional to the message size. Since this cost is not included in the gas estimation, the actual gas required may exceed the estimated amount. If the relayMessage function runs out of gas during execution, the message fails.

## Impact
1. L1 -> L2 deposits may fail due to insufficient gas, even when users provide the suggested gas amount.
2. Users may need to retry transactions with higher gas limits, leading to increased overall costs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The proper fix involves adding the gas calculation for hashing the cross-domain message. This is done by introducing two new constants:
```solidity 
/** * @notice BASE gas reserved for Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessage */
uint64 public constant HASH_MESSAGE_BASE_GAS = 800;

/** * @notice Extra gas reserved for per-byte in Hashing.hashCrossDomainMessage */
uint64 public constant HASH_MESSAGE_GAS_PER_BYTE = 2;
```

The baseGas() function should be updated to include these new gas calculations:
```solidity
    function baseGas(bytes calldata _message, uint32 _minGasLimit) public pure returns (uint64) {
        return
        // Constant overhead
        RELAY_CONSTANT_OVERHEAD
        // Calldata overhead
        + (uint64(_message.length) * MIN_GAS_CALLDATA_OVERHEAD)
        // Hash message
        (uint64(_message.length) * HASH_MESSAGE_GAS_PER_BYTE) + HASH_MESSAGE_BASE_GAS 
        // Dynamic overhead (EIP-150)
        + ((_minGasLimit * MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_NUMERATOR) / MIN_GAS_DYNAMIC_OVERHEAD_DENOMINATOR)
        // Gas reserved for the worst-case cost of 3/5 of the `CALL` opcode's dynamic gas
        // factors. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_CALL_OVERHEAD
        // Relay reserved gas (to ensure execution of `relayMessage` completes after the
        // subcontext finishes executing) (Conservative)
        + RELAY_RESERVED_GAS
        // Gas reserved for the execution between the `hasMinGas` check and the `CALL`
        // opcode. (Conservative)
        + RELAY_GAS_CHECK_BUFFER;
    }
```
