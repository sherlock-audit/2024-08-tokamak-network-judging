# Misleading `Payable` Function with Restrictive `msg.value` Check in `L1CrossDomainMessenger`

## Summary
The `relayMessage` function in the `CrossDomainMessenger` contract is marked as payable, but contains a requirement `(require(msg.value == 0)` that prevents any Ether (ETH) from being transferred along with the message. This introduces a vulnerability that could confuse users or developers into thinking the function can handle ETH deposits when it cannot, leading to potential user errors and contract misuse.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `relayMessage` function is unnecessarily marked as payable, yet immediately checks that `msg.value` is `zero` via `require(msg.value == 0)`. The purpose of the payable modifier is to allow the contract to receive ETH, but this check effectively negates that functionality, confusing its intent and misleading developers into thinking the function supports ETH transfers.
## Impact
**1.User Confusion:** Users or developers may be misled into sending ETH along with this function call, expecting it to be accepted due to the payable modifier, but the function will reject such transactions.
**2.Potential Funds Loss:** Although the `require(msg.value == 0)` prevents any ETH from being transferred, this could cause users to unintentionally send ETH and see their transactions fail, leading to higher gas fees due to reverts.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
**1.Remove the payable modifier:** Since the function is not intended to handle ETH transfers, removing the `payable modifier` will align the function's behavior with its intended use, preventing user confusion.
**2.Explicit Documentation:** Document that the function does not accept ETH and explain the rationale behind the `msg.value == 0` check.
